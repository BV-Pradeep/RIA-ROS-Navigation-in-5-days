# ROS-Navigation-in-5-days-Robot-Ignite-Academy
These are my projects created during ROS Navigation course by Robot Ignite Academy

## Brief summary

The objective of this course is to give you the basic tools and knowledge to be able to understand and create any basic ROS Navigation related project.

You will be able to create maps of environments, localize the robot in the environment, make the robots perform path planning, visualize data of the different Navigation processes, debug errors using RViz and configure the different Navigation nodes.
What you will learn

## What is needed to perform robot navigation with ROS ?
- The Navigation Stack
- The move_base node


At the end of the course you will be comfortable with the following subjects:
````
   1. The ROS Navigation Stack
   2. What is needed to work with the Navigation Stack
   3. What is the move_base node and why it is so important
   4. Which parts take place in the move_base node
````
